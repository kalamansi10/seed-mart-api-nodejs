# Seed-Mart - Node.js Backend API

This repository contains the Node.js backend API for Seed-Mart.

## Getting Started

This is a work in progess.

## Issues

### passport-remember-me

The strategy is currently unmaintained and does not work properly with the latest version of Passport. The module uses ‘passport’ instead of ‘passport-strategy’ for its dependency and needs to be updated manually in order to use it.

# About Seed-Mart

Seed-Mart is a personal project of mine designed to showcase my current proficiency in web development. It is an e-commerce website that focuses on modularity and scalability. Every component of the application was made with flexibility in mind.

My vision for the project was to create different versions of the frontend app using various frameworks, along with multiple versions of the backend server, each deployed separately. The aim was to seamlessly integrate them, allowing any frontend version to function with any backend version.

But as I continue my web development journey, I've come to realize that separating the frontend and backend isn't always practical, especially for websites handling forms, user sessions, and authentication. Opting for a framework that integrates both, following the MVC pattern, would save considerable time compared to building them separately, thanks to the well-supported libraries in this kind of implementation.

I'm determined to achieve my goal, even though this project will primarily serve as practice. Being bilingual (English and Tagalog), I often hear a phrase: "If you can translate a foreign language to your native language, you're proficient in that language." I believe the same applies to coding. If I can translate an app I've built into a different framework or language, it indicates a solid understanding of the new framework or language I'm learning.
